The current status of cloud computing, IT services and servers have all progressed extremely quickly and are all at an advanced position now in the IT world. Cloud computing is now used in everyday life as it offers the users access and security to all their files they need to access say from different locations or devices at any given time with the safety aspect of not worrying about losing files or them getting stolen. Cloud computing is hard to say where it will be in 3 years time as it has been around for a while already and some experts say that it has already reached its limit in how much it can expand and introduce new features that revolutionise cloud computing but they speeds in downloading/uploading and the storage amount can always been improved upon. The fast speeds and bigger storage can be made possible by the always expanding capabilities of our internet services and evolving products in storage disks and other hardware components.

IT services currently also allow many possibilities whether it be a IT professional come in and set up a whole network for a company or that can make remote changes to your personal server for better performance, etc. As the technology advances, the serverces also get more convenient and allow them to do a lot more. I believe the services over the next 3 years will expand hugely, more of the work will become more remote meaning they can reach out to their customers faster and more efficient and either get the problem fixed faster or identify the problem faster and get someone out there physically to fix the problem already knowing what’s wrong with the system and know exactly what they need to do to fix it. The whole process will be more efficient that it will revolutionise peoples opinions on technology and improve their standings on IT services for those that are not that well skilled in IT.
